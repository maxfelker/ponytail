# Web Platform Lookup

**Task:** "Add a modal dialog that closes when you click the backdrop."

Rung 3 of the ladder is "native platform feature covers it?" On web work the
trap is that the agent forgets what the platform already does and reaches for a
library. When ponytail has [Modern Web Guidance](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/modern-web-guidance)
on hand, rung 3 gets a lookup: `modern-web search "modal dialog light dismiss"`.

## Without Ponytail

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog
```

```jsx
import * as Dialog from "@radix-ui/react-dialog";

export default function Modal({ open, onOpenChange, children }) {
  return (
    <Dialog.Root open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
      <Dialog.Portal>
        <Dialog.Overlay className="overlay" />
        <Dialog.Content className="content">
          {children}
          <Dialog.Close className="close">×</Dialog.Close>
        </Dialog.Content>
      </Dialog.Portal>
    </Dialog.Root>
  );
}
```

A dependency, a portal, an overlay node, and controlled open state, to put a
box on top with a backdrop.

## With Ponytail

`modern-web search "modal dialog light dismiss"` →
`modern-web retrieve light-dismiss-a-dialog`. The platform has it:

```html
<!-- ponytail: <dialog> + closedby, browser does the backdrop, focus trap, and Esc -->
<dialog closedby="any">
  <p>...</p>
</dialog>
```

```js
document.querySelector("dialog").showModal();
```

**1 dependency + portal/overlay machinery → 0 dependencies + a `<dialog>`.**
The `::backdrop` is free, focus is trapped and restored for you, `Esc` closes
it, and `closedby="any"` adds click-outside dismissal. The browser team did the
work.

## The point

MWG suggests the cutting edge, ponytail keeps only the rung that holds. The
lookup found `light-dismiss-a-dialog`; the ladder took it because it deletes a
dependency. The same search would have offered scroll-driven animations and
view transitions for other tasks, and the ladder would have skipped them when
the task didn't need them. Lookup, not license.
